### Colour Scheme
<ul>
    <li>
        For the colours of the webpage I went with light background overall with the counter colours different colours for each individual counter, then the background for the main-game section is a darker shade of a similar colour to the main page background, the sections within the main-game section have the same colour as the main page background. Both the icons and text within the darker background have the same light colour for contrast and all text within the lighter background have a darker colour for contrast. all chosen colours were tested for contrast using <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">webaim.org contrast checker</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

### Fonts
<ul>
    <li>
        For the fonts, I used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a>. For the entire page, I used 'Kanit' as I felt it worked well with the colour scheme, was appealing and very readable for the user.
    </li>
</ul>

### Icons
<ul>
    <li>
        For the icons I used <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>. I chose the icons of hands in the positions of the symbol for rock, paper and scissors in the game as these symbols are universaly known as the symbol for these characters in the game. The two symbols for the extra characters were a man in a suit for John Wick as he wears a suit and tie in the movies, It is his signature look, And a stickman kicking for Chuck Norris as he is known best as a martial artist.
